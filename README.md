# Node Web Scraper

### Lighthouse Labs Week 7 exercise

A tool used to create a csv file  containing file permissions, links and file extensions from http://substack.net/images/

I learned:

* how to use Node.js modules:
  * request - used for http client requests
  * cheerio - adds jQuery syntax to Node (great for traversing DOM elements of the html returned from 'request')
  * json2csv - save data to a csv file
